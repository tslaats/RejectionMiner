Welcome to the rejection miner!

Please note that at the moment the miner is in a prototype state, meant as a companion to the paper "Weighing the Pros and Cons: Process Discovery with Negative Examples".

To try the miner for yourself, simply download the repository and open one of the html files in your browser. 

The tools have been thoroughly tested in Chrome Version 84.0.4147.89, but no issues with other modern browsers are expected.

The different html files are as follows:
- index.html: a start page with links to the other pages.
- mining.html: implements the main rejection miner, supports loading either a single XES log, or a zip file containing multiple such logs.
- kfold.html: a highly experimental tool for performing k-fold validation with the miner. The default setting is 10 (randomized) runs with k=10, as reported in the paper.
- cleaning.html: a highly experimental tool for transforming the DCR Solutions log format into XES and fully anonymizing the source log.
- dreyers.html: a highly experimental tool for transforming the original logformay provided for the Dreyer case into XES with labelled positive and negative examples.
